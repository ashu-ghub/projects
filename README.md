created a multi_seq finite state machine as a part of my assignment in reconfigurable computing.

![fsm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/062a6160-efaf-4343-839b-e91b1b2df357)
Non-overlapping sequence of 1100_0011,which has been detected using the seven states from S0-S6.
Used the mealy method for designing the fsm.
To represent 7 states,three bits are sufficient,so i have defined the state parameters from 000-110.
